This Repo details instructions on how to use these artifacts can be found on my blog post about the AWS re:Invent 2015

What's here

- AWS Cli install script - 'BuildRedshiftMatillionWorkshop.sh'
- Two Matillion ETL for Redshift jobs - 'Data Load.json' & 'Data Transform.json'
- Tableau workbook for this scenario - 'Redshift Flights.twb'
